This is my first Github sharing project. While I was trying to upload this project I meet some problems which prevent me from uploading all of the files. Because I choosed use git as version control with this project in the Xcode for this project, I met uploading and sharing problem because the project has already version controlled under git. After I deleted the .git files in the project folder, I was able to upload the whole project files to github.
This project used Google Speech Recognitioin API. While you are recording it will display a sine voice graph. The text of the speech will be received after your speech as json data.
