This is my first Github sharing project. While I was trying to upload this project I meet some problems which prevent 
me from uploading this project. Because I choosed use git as version control with this project, I met uploading problem. 
After I deleted the .git files in the project folder, I was able to upload the whole project to github. 

This project used Google Speech Recognitioin API and while you are recording it will display a sine voice graph. 
The text will be received after your speech as json data.
